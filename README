c) How to run:
    python main.py <bing account key> <precision> <query>
    where:
        * bing account key: the Bing Account Key used for searching
        * precision: a real number between 0 and 1
        * query: a list of words in single quotes


d) Internal design:
    1. Overview of program structure
        The entry point of this program is main.py. After the search engine is setup with the Bing account key, the
        routine to retrieve the relative results will start. There are mainly four stages in the routine: search,
        parsing, judgement, and query expansion.

        At the beginning of the routine, the query term list is processed by the search engine to form the request to
        the Bing server. In our setting, the result of the search from the Bing server will contain top-10 relevant
        web sites and be of XML format. The XML object is then parsed to get the information for users to decide
        whether each result is indeed relevant or not.

        After the judgement process is done, the program terminates if the desired relevance of the result is met or
        there is totally no relevant result. However, when there are relevant results but the relevance requirement
        is not met, the routine must be redone to get more relevant results. For the next routine, we pass the entire
        judgement result including the content of search results to the query expansion module which can compute the
        best fit words for the next round. The routine is then repeated until the relevance requirement is met.

    1. The program is composed of 2 parts
    2. The query expansion algorithm is written in QueryExpansion.py

2. Give different weights to title and description
        Based on our survey of the research papers, we find that we need to assign different weights to the terms in
    different part. For example, if a term is in the title, we should assign more weight to it. Therefore, after numbers
    of experiments, we have chosen to assign 1.2 to the terms in the title while 1 to the others.

3. calculate the normalized term frequency for each document
        We take the normalized term frequency instead of the original term frequency. This is calculated by dividing
    the length of the document.

4. tf-idf

5. Rocchio algorithm
        The key part of our query modification algorithm is Rocchio algorithm, which is also the most popular algorithm
    in query expansion.

g) Additional information:
1. Character encoding:
        When we construct the inverted files, one of the nasty problems we encounter is character encoding. Some results
    in XML are returned containing unicode encoding characters and they induce some unexpected results. Since the
    unicode characters are generally special symbols, our approach is simply replacing each of them with a whitespace.

        Compared to using <string>.encode('ascii', 'ignore), this approach can help us get words correctly. In
    encode('ascii', 'ignore'), the non-ascii characters are simple skipped, which results in that some words seperated
    with these non-ascii symbols will become one word and this result is not we expect. In our observation, because the
    most information lies in alphanumeric characters which are most of the time ascii-encoded, even if we replace the
    non-ascii characters with whitespaces, the important information is still preserved.
